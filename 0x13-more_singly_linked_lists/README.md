# More Singly Linked
### The files for "More singly linked lists" can be found in this directory. Unidirectional linked lists, such as singly linked lists, can only be navigated from head to last node (tail). A node is the name given to each entry in a linked list. In order to keep the list's structure, each node contains data plus a pointer to the next node.
